## 🎯 Overview
This is a hands-on project that uses **Azure Data Factory (ADF)** to build a complete data pipeline for processing and analyzing COVID-19 data.  
The project integrates **ingestion, transformation, and loading (ETL/ELT)** using Azure services such as ADF, Data Lake, SQL Database, and Blob Storage.  

The goal is to transform raw data from external sources into a structured repository, enabling data analysis, reporting, or visualization.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Azure Data Factory** (Pipelines, Mapping Data Flows, triggers, orchestration)  
- **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 / Blob Storage** for raw and processed data  
- **Azure SQL Database** for storing final or processed data
